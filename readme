Building Module
===============

The module is normally built using the Yocto build system
It can however be built standalone, but will need some dependencies for that to work

The Makefile has been updated so It should work with a Yocto 3.3 tree

Prerequisites
-------------

- Build a *flir-image* in your yocto tree
- Set environment variables *YOCTO_DIRECTORY* and *CAMAPPS_DIRECTORY*
  - YOCTO_DIRECTORY is the path to your top level yocto directory,
    e.g. /path/evco-3.3 directory
  - CAMAPPS_DIRECTORY is the path to your top level camapps directory

Building
--------

Run (you need to select the correct directories)

source /opt/poky/3.3-cortexa9t2hf/environment-setup-cortexa9t2hf-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi
YOCTO_DIRECTORY=/src/evco-3.3 CAMAPPS_DIRECTORY=/src/camapps make

Assuming everything is correct, the make system will use the right toolchain etc..

Deploying yildun module to camera
---------------------------------

The makefile contains the following deploy targets

- deploy -- deploy yildun.ko to home directory of user on camera



Verifying that FPGA was successfully loaded
-------------------------------------------

Currently, the CONF_DONE pin is verified after load
to be right level to know that the FPGA has been loaded

An improvment to this Is to check CONF_DONE also when the FPGA
isnt programmed, so we know that the value changes
